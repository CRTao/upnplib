upnplib
=======

UPNP port mapping library (currently UPNP 1.0)

This code is based on the "sbbi-upnplib" library from www.sbbi.net.
That code was Apache licensed; our modifications are LGPL v3 licensed.

Over time we expect to support UPNP 1.1 and, hopefully, NAT-PMP.

Or this library could be replaced with a completely different one.  Who
knows? ;-)
